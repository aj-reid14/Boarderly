# Boardely 

A web app to create vision boards. A vision board is a collage of images, pictures and quotes designed 
to help clarify and concentrate on one's goals as visualization is one powerful mind exercise. 

# What is the purpose of this app? 
Starting 2020, we wanted to give our users an everyday app to make vision boards online. 
Procrastination is a real issue. Usually, It happens when the task seems to be too hard to accomplish. We live in a world where we are easily distracted.
This app is supposed to help users keep and maintain their real goals and aspirations on their day to day.

The left side of the app is used to create and manage both existing and new vision boards. 
The right side of the screen is used as an online vision board editor.
